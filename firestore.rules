/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset establishes a clear boundary between public, read-only application data and private, user-owned data. Public content like workouts, products, and trainer info is globally readable to support the app's features for all users. Private data, such as a member's personal information, is strictly protected, ensuring a user can only access and manage their own documents.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized into a flat hierarchy of top-level collections. This structural segregation simplifies security rules, as each collection has a uniform access control pattern. For example, the `/members/{memberId}` collection follows a strict ownership model, while the `/workouts` collection is public. There are no nested subcollections, which avoids complex hierarchical rule logic.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Member Data Isolation: A user's personal data in `/members/{memberId}` is accessible only to them. The document ID (`memberId`) must match the authenticated user's UID. Listing of all members is explicitly disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - Public App Content: Collections like `/subscriptions`, `/workouts`, `/trainers`, and `/products` are treated as public, read-only data. This allows any client (authenticated or not) to fetch this information, but prevents any client-side modification, ensuring data integrity. Changes to this data must be made through a trusted admin environment (e.g., the Firebase Console or a backend server).
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `members` documents contain an `id` field that is validated to match the document's ID and the user's UID, ensuring relational integrity between the user's identity and their data record.
