/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset establishes a clear boundary between public, read-only application data and private, user-owned data. Public content like workouts, products, and trainer info is globally readable to support the app's features for all users. Private data, such as a member's personal information, is strictly protected, ensuring a user can only access and manage their own documents.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized into a flat hierarchy of top-level collections. The `/members/{memberId}` collection uses the member's phone number as the document ID for unified access, while security is enforced by matching the authenticated user's UID against an `id` field within the document.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Member Data Unification: A member's data in `/members/{memberId}` (where memberId is the phone number) is accessible only to them. Ownership is verified by matching the user's auth UID with the `id` field stored inside the document. This allows both the web app and other systems to reference the same document via phone number, while maintaining strict user-level security.
 * - Public App Content: Collections like `/subscriptions`, `/workouts`, `/trainers`, and `/products` are treated as public, read-only data. This allows any client (authenticated or not) to fetch this information, but prevents any client-side modification, ensuring data integrity. Changes to this data must be made through a trusted admin environment (e.g., the Firebase Console or a backend server).
 * - Write-Only Feedback: The `/feedback` collection is designed for users to submit content without being able to read, update, or delete it, preventing misuse.
