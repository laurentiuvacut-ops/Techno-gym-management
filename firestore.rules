/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset establishes a clear boundary between public, read-only application data and private, user-owned data. Public content like workouts, products, and trainer info is globally readable to support the app's features for all users. Private data, such as a member's personal information, is strictly protected, ensuring a user can only access and manage their own documents.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized into a flat hierarchy of top-level collections. For /members/{memberId}, the document ID {memberId} MUST match the authenticated user's UID. This is the most secure and standard way to handle user-specific data in Firestore.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - UID as Primary Key: Each member's data is stored in a document where the ID is the user's Firebase Authentication UID. This provides a direct, secure link between the authenticated user and their data, preventing one user from accessing another's information.
 * - Public App Content: Collections like `/subscriptions`, `/workouts`, `/trainers`, and `/products` are treated as public, read-only data. This allows any client (authenticated or not) to fetch this information, but prevents any client-side modification, ensuring data integrity. Changes to this data must be made through a trusted admin environment (e.g., the Firebase Console or a backend server).
 * - Write-Only Feedback: The `/feedback` collection is designed for users to submit content without being able to read, update, or delete it, preventing misuse.
